            <p>Married, with children, I now spend my time hiking, biking, and working out.
                I also get to spend a lot of time with our dog, Cooper.  Being a hound, Cooper
                keeps us busy, especially when he catches the scent of a rabbit or a squirrel.
                I spent almost 30 years as a Cobol programmer on a legacy mainframe system but
                now I am leaning more current and relavent technologies so that I may reenter
                the workforce.

                    <p>As the senior VP, I was in charge of all aspects of the programming, ranging
                        from maintenance of pre-existing applications, new programming requests, 
                        integration of new technologies, and implementing new software and hardware 
                        requirements.

                    <p>Led the development of the application which was used to port the AccuRecord
                        book of business from the AccuRecord platform to the Diversified platform. This
                        application afforded Transamerica the ability to move off the AccuRecord platform 
                        ahead of schedule and resulted in the direct savings of over $10 million dollars in
                        cost.
